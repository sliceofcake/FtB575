# FtB575
Version 575 of Online Rhythm Game, Feel the Beats  

[Most Up-To-Date Semi-Public Online Build](https://feelthebeats.se/575_2016_08_21/edit/)  

Some Reminders Copy-Pasted From [The FtB5 /boards/ Dev News Subboard](https://feelthebeats.se/boards/?nyan=13):  

**Use the newest version of the Google Chrome web browser.**  
If you don't have Chrome, this link will probably take you to the official download page [https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/). "Why only Chrome?" : [https://feelthebeats.se/boards/?nyan=13&cat=432](https://feelthebeats.se/boards/?nyan=13&cat=432). The newest versions of Firefox are now somewhat compatible with FtB575.  

**Use a bogus password [some builds don't have server connectivity].**  
Do not submit private/confidential information to FtB575. The system is not currently secure.  

**Use CBR [Constant Bit Rate] audio files. Don't use VBR [Variable Bit Rate] audio files.**  
The gameframe will do a terrible job when it tries to seek to a specific point in a VBR song.  

**Remember that the gameframe will play osu files.**  
You have to open the .osz file as a zip [perhaps, rename the extension to .zip, and then open it more easily], and grab the audio file and the chart file [.osu].  

How to use : drag an audio file to the corresponding panel, ditto for chart file, hit the reset key if necessary. Score is currently not calculated.
